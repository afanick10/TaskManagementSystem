# Task Management System

This is a basic task management system using Django for a user interface and PostgreSQL to store records of tasks. This application
makes use of Bootstrap classes for stylings. It also makes use of Docker containerization.

## My Approach

As this was my first application developed using Django, I found myself in unfamiliar territory. I spent quite a bit of time debugging
issues relating to configurations. I had to learn the best practices for structuring the project (you can't necessarily approach a Django
application the same you would for .NET or React application).
